## Deployed Version

Live demo (Feel free to visit) ðŸ‘‰ : https://rnt-clothings.herokuapp.com/

## API Usage

Check:

[RNT Cloth API Documentation Postman](https://rnt-clothing.herokuapp.com/)

[RNT Cloth API Documentation Swagger](https://rnt-clothing.herokuapp.com/)

for more info.

## Deployment

The website is deployed with git into heroku. Below are the steps taken:

```
$  git init
$  heroku login
$  heroku create <heroku_app_name> --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
$  heroku git:remote -a <heroku_app_name>
$  git add -A
$  git commit -m "Commit message"
$  git push heroku main
$  heroku open
```

## Installation

You can fork the app or you can git-clone the app into your local machine. Once done that, please install all the dependencies by running

```sh
 npm i
 npm start

```

or

```sh
 yarn i
 yarn start

```

## Run App in Development for client / React

```sh
 npm start
```

or

```sh
 yarn start
```

## Updating packages and latest version of react

### 1) Updating Packages

Open Terminal

```sh
 git clone **Link HTTP/SSH Repository
 cd ** Into directory folder
```

remove yarn.lock

```sh
ls
rm -rf yarn.lock
```

update dev dependency

```sh
npm update -D
```

if vulnerabilities found

```sh
npm audit fix
```

install npm dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

repeate if vulnerabilities founded again
try to fix any issue

```sh
npm audit fix
npm audit
```

Run the App

```sh
npm start
```

### 2) Update latest version React to Github

```sh
code .
git add -A
git commit -m "Updated packages to latest version, remove and fixed any vulderabilities"
git push origin **branch_name
```
